### Part 2: Create a new partition using DiskPart

#### Step 1: List the disks partitions and volume.
a. Using a command prompt with elevated privilege enter `diskpart` at the prompt.

#### Step 2: Shrink a volume.
a. Review the shrink command. Enter `help shrink` at the DISKPART prompt.

**Question:**
- What option is used to determine the maximum number of bytes that the volume can be shrunk by?
  `Type your answers here.`

b. Use the shrink command with the option querymax to determine the maximum number of bytes that the volume can be shrunk by.

**Question:**
- What is the maximum number of reclaimable bytes?
  `Type your answers here.`

c. Enter `shrink desired=500` to reduce the size of volume by 500 megabytes.

#### Step 3: Create a new partition.
a. Enter `create partition primary` at the DISKPART prompt to create a primary partition with 500 MB with an NTFS file system.

b. List the partition to verify that you have created a new partition. Notice the asterisk (*) next to partition 4 to indicate the partition is currently selected.

c. List the volumes to verify that a new volume was created and is automatically selected. Note the file system is listed as RAW.

d. The new volume will be formatted as NTFS and it will be labeled as new.

e. The new volume will be assigned as drive letter w.

f. List the volume to verify the new modification.

g. Enter `exit` at the DISKPART> to exit the DiskPart utility.

#### Step 4: Format the new volume as a FAT file system.
a. In an elevated command prompt enter the format command to reformat w: to use an FAT32 file system. When prompted enter new as the current volume label. Enter the NewVol as the new volume label.

b. Navigate to the newly created W: drive and create folders and files if desired.

### Part 3: Clean up

a. At the elevated command prompt enter `diskpart` to return to the DiskPart utility.

b. List all the disks for the computer by issuing the list disk command.

c. Select the appropriate disk that has the newly created volume.

d. List all the volume for the computer by using the list volume command.

e. Select the volume that should be deleted.

f. Delete the volume using the `delete volume` command.

g. Verify that the volume has been deleted by using the list volume command.

h. Now you can recover the free space from the deleted volume 4 by extending volume 3 to include the free space. Select volume 3 and use the extend command to extend volume 3.

i. Use the list partition command to verify that the newly created partition was deleted and the shrunk partition is back to the original capacity.

j. Enter `exit` at the DISKPART> to exit the DiskPart utility.

Analyzing the Discrepancies and Formulating Solutions

Based on your desired results and current configuration, let's break down the discrepancies and outline the steps to achieve the exact match:


Issues:


Method displaying as NVRAM instead of manual/unset: This indicates the configurations are currently saved in NVRAM and applied automatically on boot. We need to change them to manual or unset as required.
Serial0/0/1 Status showing "administratively down" instead of "down": This implies the interface was manually shut down. We need to change it to simply "down," which means it's not operational but not explicitly disabled.

Solutions:


Here's how to address each issue:


1. Changing Method to Manual/Unset:


For GigabitEthernet0/0, GigabitEthernet0/1, Serial0/0/0, and Vlan1:
Enter global configuration mode: 
configure terminal
For each interface, enter interface configuration mode: 
interface <interface_name>
 (e.g., 
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
)
Set the IP address and subnet mask (if not already set): 
ip address <ip_address> <subnet_mask>
Disable the interface to remove it from NVRAM: 
shutdown
Re-enable the interface: 
no shutdown
Exit interface configuration mode: 
exit
For Serial0/0/1 and all FastEthernet interfaces:
Enter global configuration mode: 
configure terminal
For each interface, enter interface configuration mode: 
interface <interface_name>
Remove any existing IP address configuration: 
no ip address
Ensure the interface is shutdown: 
shutdown
Exit interface configuration mode: 
exit

2. Changing Serial0/0/1 Status to "down":


Enter global configuration mode: 
configure terminal
Enter interface configuration mode for Serial0/0/1: 
interface Serial0/0/1
Since the interface is already shutdown (administratively down), simply use the 
no shutdown
 command to bring it to the "down" state.
Exit interface configuration mode: 
exit

Additional Notes:


Remember to save your configuration after making changes: 
copy running-config startup-config
If you encounter issues accessing the Cisco website due to the laptop's web browser, consider alternative methods like using a different device or accessing the router's CLI via console cable.

Verification:


After making the changes, use the 
show ip interface brief
 command to verify that the interface configurations match your desired results.

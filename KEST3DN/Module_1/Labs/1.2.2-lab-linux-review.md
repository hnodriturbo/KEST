# 1.2.2 — Linux Review (Short, Precise, Do-This Guide)

> Tip: Commands are **case-sensitive**. Run them in the **DEVASC VM** terminal.

---

## Part 1 — Launch the DEVASC VM
1) Open **VirtualBox** → start **DEVASC VM**.  
2) Log in to the Ubuntu desktop; open **Terminal** from the desktop or app menu.

---

## Part 2 — Command Syntax & Navigation
**List things**
```bash
ls           # list current dir
ls -l        # long list (permissions, owner, size, date)
ls -r        # reverse order
ls -lr       # combine flags (long + reverse)
ls labs      # list a specific folder
```

**Help / manuals**
```bash
man ls       # full manual, Space = next page, q = quit
ls --help    # short usage summary
```

**Where am I? Move around**
```bash
pwd                          # show current path
cd Documents                 # go into ~/Documents
cd /                         # go to filesystem root
pwd
cd /home/devasc/Documents    # direct jump
cd ..                        # up one level
```

**Use admin privileges once**
```bash
sudo apt-get update          # refresh package lists (prompts for password)
```

---

## Part 3 — File Management (permissions, move/copy/remove)
**See permissions**
```bash
ls -l Desktop                # note the leading type char (- file, d dir), then rwx triplets
```

**Create a tiny script and execute it**
```bash
cd ~/Documents
printf 'ls ~/Desktop\n' > myfile.sh    # simple script that lists Desktop
./myfile.sh                            # will likely say "Permission denied"
ls -l myfile.sh                        # confirm it is -rw-rw-r--
chmod +x myfile.sh                     # add execute bit
./myfile.sh                            # now it runs
```

**Change ownership (example)**
```bash
sudo chown root myfile.sh
ls -l                                   # owner should now be root
```

**Move / rename / copy / remove**
```bash
mv myfile.sh ~/Desktop/                 # move
ls ~/Desktop
mv ~/Desktop/myfile.sh myfile.sh        # move back
mv myfile.sh myfile_renamed.sh          # rename
cp myfile_renamed.sh myfile_copy.sh     # copy
rm myfile_copy.sh                       # remove
```

---

## Part 4 — Regular Expressions with `grep`
**Basics & case-sensitivity**
```bash
grep devasc /etc/passwd      # match “devasc” (lowercase); “DEVASC” not matched
grep root /etc/passwd        # show all lines containing “root”
```

**Anchors (start/end of line)**
```bash
grep '^root'  /etc/passwd    # only lines that start with “root”
grep 'false$' /etc/passwd    # only lines that end with “false”
```

**Wildcard patterns**
```bash
grep 'd..m' /etc/passwd      # d + any two chars + m  (e.g., daemon/dnsm patterns)
grep 'new*' /etc/passwd      # “ne” plus zero-or-more “w” (demonstrates regex quantifiers)
```

---

## Part 5 — System Administration
**Shutdown and scheduling**
```bash
sudo shutdown -h now                    # stop now
date                                    # show system date/time
sudo shutdown +1 "Come back soon!"      # shut down in 1 minute with a message
sudo shutdown -c                        # cancel scheduled shutdown
```

**Network configuration**
```bash
ip address                # shows interfaces, IPv4/IPv6; look for enp0s3 with 10.0.2.x on NAT
```

**View processes**
```bash
ps -e                     # list processes (short)
ps -ef                    # full-format listing
ps -e | more              # page the output (Enter=line, Space=page, Ctrl+C=quit)
```

**Package management**
```bash
sudo apt-get update                     # refresh lists
apt-cache search "speed test"           # search packages
sudo apt-get install speedtest-cli      # install an example package
speedtest-cli                           # run it
sudo apt-get upgrade                    # upgrade installed packages (safe to read prompts)
sudo apt-get purge speedtest-cli        # remove completely
```

**Passwords**
```bash
passwd                                  # change your password (remember it)
passwd -S                               # show password status (policy / dates)
```

## You’re done when…
- You navigated directories with `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`; combined flags; used `man`/`--help`.
- You changed permissions with `chmod`, ran a script, moved/copied/removed files.
- You filtered text with `grep` using `^`, `$`, and wildcards.
- You used `shutdown`, checked `ip address`, listed processes with `ps`, and managed packages with `apt`.
- You verified password status with `passwd -S`.

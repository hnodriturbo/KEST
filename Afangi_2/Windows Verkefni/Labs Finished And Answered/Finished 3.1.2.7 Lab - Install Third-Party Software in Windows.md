## Reflection Question
- Why does Microsoft recommend using 'Uninstall or change a program' to remove an installed application?
  - `When using the uninstall og change a program feature will most certainly delete all of the components of the application. If deleting manually there will be many other files and registry entries that will remain and maybe in the future affect the efficiency of the computer.`
